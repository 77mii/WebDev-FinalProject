## Description
A webapp I made for the group assignment for Web Development ALP. This webapp is for displaying the portofolio of students to other students, lecturers, guests, and educational administrators

##Information
This project uses PHP'S Laravel framework for both the front and back end and uses MySQL for the database
In this project i focused on the Guest and Student Roles of both the back and frontend.
What we've learned from this project is how to develop webapps using PHP'S laravel framework which uses The MVC (Model View Controller) Structure and how to connect the webapp to a MySQL database
